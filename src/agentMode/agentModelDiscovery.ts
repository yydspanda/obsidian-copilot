 *
 * First enrollment of an `agentType` creates the provider and seeds the enabled
 * set to the model the agent reports as current; every later probe only
 * reconciles the model list (no provider-row write), so re-probes don't churn
 * settings.

 * `opencode/big-pickle`) so ids stay globally unique and UI sub-grouping can be
 * derived from the wire-id prefix.
